        <p class="lead mb-4">Sociology is an exciting and illuminating field of study that analyzes and explains important matters in our personal lives, our communities, and the world. At the personal level, sociology investigates the social causes and consequences of such things as romantic love, racial and gender identity, family conflict, deviant behavior, aging, and religious faith. At the societal level, sociology examines and explains matters like crime and law, poverty and wealth, prejudice and discrimination, schools and education, business firms, urban community, and social movements. At the global level, sociology studies such phenomena as population growth and migration, war and peace, and economic development. Sociologists emphasize the careful gathering and analysis of evidence about social life to develop and enrich our understanding of key social processes. The research methods sociologists use are varied. Sociologists observe the everyday life of groups, conduct large-scale surveys, interpret historical documents, analyze census data, study video-taped interactions, interview participants of groups, and conduct laboratory experiments. Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behavior. Sociologists investigate the structure of groups, organizations, and societies, and how people interact within these contexts. Since all human behavior is social, the subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate family to the hostile mob; from organized crime to religious cults; from the divisions of race, gender and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture; and from the sociology of work to the sociology of sports. In fact, few fields have such broad scope and relevance for research, theory, and application of knowledge. Sociology provides many distinctive perspectives on the world, generating new ideas and critiquing the old. The field also offers a range of research techniques that can be applied to virtually any aspect of social life: street crime and delinquency, corporate downsizing, how people express emotions, welfare or education reform, how families differ and flourish, or problems of peace and war. Because sociology addresses the most challenging issues of our time, it is a rapidly expanding field whose potential is increasingly tapped by those who craft policies and create programs. Sociologists understand social inequality, patterns of behavior, forces for social change and resistance, and how social systems work. As the following pages convey, sociology is an exciting discipline with expanding opportunities for a wide range of career paths. All sociologists are interested in the experiences of individuals and how those experiences are shaped by interactions with social groups and society as a whole. To a sociologist, the personal decisions an individual makes do not exist in a vacuum. Cultural patterns and social forces put pressure on people to select one choice over another. Sociologists try to identify these general patterns by examining the behavior of large groups of people living in the same society and experiencing the same societal pressure.<br><br>

        Students who have been well trained in sociology know how to think critically about human social life, and how to ask important research questions. These are all abilities of tremendous value in a wide variety of vocational callings and professions. Sociology offers a distinctive and enlightening way of seeing and understanding the social world in which we live and which shapes our lives. Sociology looks beyond normal, taken-for-granted views of reality, to provide deeper, more illuminating and challenging understandings of social life. Through its particular analytical perspective, social theories, and research methods, sociology is a discipline that expands our awareness and analysis of the human social relationships, cultures, and institutions that profoundly shape both our lives and human history. One of the most frequent questions students ask about sociology is, ‚ÄúWhat can I do with a sociology degree?‚Äù The answer is that the career potential of sociology majors is almost limitless. Sociologists are employed by research institutes, the criminal justice system, public health and welfare organizations, private businesses.  Social research also has an impact in different business industries and sectors. Examples include policy makers, developers, social workers and administrators. As such, there is a lot of overlap between social research and market research. For example, a sociologist may discover that a given country has an age difference due to an epidemic. These analytical insights help business people to research this market data and draw the conclusions needed. In addition, sociological studies can help understand the different motivators of employees with different demographics. It is noted, for instance, that there is a difference in the way men and women approach their job applications. Understanding why certain populations fit certain patterns of behavior can help build a more inclusive workplace that meets the needs of everyone in the company. Another sociology definition is the general science of society. The most basic and all encompassing sociology definition is a field of study or science. Traditional focuses in sociology include social classes, religion, law, social mobility, gender, and more. Gradually, the focus of the field has expanded to other topics such as economics, military, control, the Internet and social capital. The factors that preserve or change these aspects of social life and society are also included in the study of sociology. Aside from a field of study, sociology also has meaning for other aspects of society. This can include sociology meaning a tool for understanding human behavior and implementing this knowledge and understanding into everyday life. All sociologists are interested in the experiences of individuals and how those experiences are shaped by interactions with social groups and society as a whole. To a sociologist, the personal decisions an individual makes do not exist in a vacuum. Cultural patterns and social forces put pressure on people to select one choice over another. Sociologists try to identify these general patterns by examining the behavior of large groups of people living in the same society and experiencing the same societal pressures.<br><br>

        Sociology is the study of human social relationships and institutions. Sociology‚Äôs subject matter is diverse, ranging from crime to religion, from the family to the state, from the divisions of race and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture, and from social stability to radical change in whole societies. Unifying the study of these diverse subjects of study is sociology‚Äôs purpose of understanding how human action and consciousness both shape and are shaped by surrounding cultural and social structures. The days when young people learned specific technical skills for one lifetime career are long gone. Today‚Äôs economy and labor market demand employees who are creative, versatile, and adaptable. The best employers are looking for people who are broadly educated in the kind of critical, analytical, organizational, and communication skills that will enable them to master new tasks and solve new problems many times over throughout their careers. Sociology is exactly the kind of major in which to learn those skills. Sociology offers its students a broad education in critical thinking, analytical problem solving, reasoned judgement, and effective communication. Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behavior. Sociologists investigate the structure of groups, organizations, and societies and how people interact within these contexts. Since all human behavior is social, the subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate family to the hostile mob; from organized crime to religious traditions; from the divisions of race, gender and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture. The video below highlights the unique contributions of sociology to the understanding of today‚Äôs most divisive issues. Sixteen sociologists speak briefly to the need for and impact of their discipline. ‚ÄúSociologists on Sociology‚Äù is a primer on a discipline that studies many of the major issues confronting American society. As one featured sociologist puts it: ‚ÄúSo much of what is going on with our political climate and the rhetoric right now is all about talking about individual people or individual communities. The reality is that these are collective problems that have structural bases.‚Äù Traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality, gender, and deviance. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; sociology of education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge. The range of social scientific methods has also expanded, as social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century, especially, have led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophical approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, the turn of the 21st century has seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis. Sociology is a social science that focuses on society, human social behavior, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life.[1][2][3] It uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis[4]:‚Ää3‚Äì5‚Ää to develop a body of knowledge about social order and social change.[4]:‚Ää32‚Äì40‚Ää While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes and phenomenological method. Subject matter can range from micro-level analyses of society (i.e. of individual interaction and agency) to macro-level analyses.
